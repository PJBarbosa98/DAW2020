Paulo Barbosa (PG40160)

TAREFA:
	Create a single page application for a `to do` list
	
	Main page should have three areas:
		=> Insert;
		=> View `to do` task list;
		=> Resolved task list;

	Task Model is composed by:
		=> dateCreated
		=> dateDued 	(deadline)
		=> who
		=> what
		=> type 		(if there are several types of tasks)

	Additionally (bonus points), add functionality
		=> edit task (PUT request)
		=> delete task (DELETE request)

	Possible Extras:
		=> Maintain lists of task types, task descriptions, ...,
			that are pre-loaded into select components

		=> Make a nice interface, even responsive
